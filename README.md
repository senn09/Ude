This repository documents my journey in taking the [Udemy Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). In it of it self I am also practicing to document my work and take notes. Its the start to me being a self-directed learner and putting in the time outside of what school has to offer.

Notes and Project Information will be found on this [notion page](https://subdued-scissor-059.notion.site/The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp-13cc7cdaf14b80b9834bdc16eb056eda?pvs=4)



## What I have Learned

### The Big Takeaway
The introductory material is a great refresher as someone who's gone through university programming courses. Good practice with how to read documentation for APIs and really good exposure to the various kinds of APIs that are availiable.
