This repository documents my journey in taking the [Udemy Python Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). In it of it self I am also practicing to document my work and take notes. Its the start to me being a self-directed learner and putting in the time outside of what school has to offer.

Notes and Project Information will be found on this [notion page](https://subdued-scissor-059.notion.site/The-Complete-Python-Pro-Bootcamp-13cc7cdaf14b80b9834bdc16eb056eda?pvs=4)
